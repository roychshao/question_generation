Thisspacing is known as a rack unit (RU), which represents a mounting height of 1.75\".Items can be mounted on the front or rear rails in a cabinet, or mounted on both the front and rear rails.Items can be referred to as being mounted in, on, above and below a cabinet.A Items mounted in cabinets are placed inside the cabinet and mounted on rails.B When an item is mounted on a cabinet, such as a rack PDU, it can be mounted on the left or right side of acabinet either on the front or back of the cabinet.The orientation is the direction an item faces when it is mounted in a cabinet. In dcTrack, item orientation is either:C \"Item Rear Faces Cabinet Front\" - the back of the device faces the same direction as the front ofthe cabinet, so that the back of the device is accessible from the front of the cabinet.D \"Item Front Faces Cabinet Front\" - the front of the device faces the same direction as the front of the cabinet,C \"Item Rear Faces Cabinet Front\" - the back of the device faces the same direction as the front ofthe cabinet, so that the back of the device is accessible from the front of the cabinet.so that the front of the device is accessible from the front of the cabinet.When an item is mounted below or above a cabinet, it is a standalone item such as a PDU, busway and so on.These items are not displayed in the Cabinet Elevations in dcTrack.The distance between the front and back rails is determined by the Depth of the cabinet as specified in the Model:The depth is the outside measurement (outside surface of back rail to outside surface of front rail).The offsets are always positive and they indicate how far into the cabinet the edge extends.For example:A cabinet whose depth is 935mm with a front offset of 10 and a rear offset of 10 would actually have an inside depthof 915mm.

For example, servers have bothpower ports and data ports, while passive items such as cabinet shelves and wire managers do not have powerports or data ports.Ports also have classes. The classes are types of ports -Data PortsPower PortsSensor/Probe PortsIf an item has ports, they are already defined for it the Sunbird Models Library file. This means you do not need tomanually create ports for an item. For example, all of the data ports and power ports for a server are included withthe server.You can create additional ports, delete existing ports, and edit ports if you have Edit privileges to an item.Data ports and sensor ports are created in the Web Client.Create power ports for Device, Network, and Probe class items in the Web Client.Data and power port connections are created in the Web Client.See Manage Circuits and Power in Your Data Centers.Ports that are already connected cannot be deleted until they are disconnected."

Connect to the VMware server using the VMware ESXi 6.5 web GUI.2. Ensure you are logged in as a user that has permission to create, start, and stop virtual machines.3. On the Virtual Machine page (check that Virtual Machines is selected in the left Navigator pane), clickCreate/Register VM.4. The New virtual machine wizard opens. In Step 1 of the New virtual machine wizard, Select the Create a newvirtual machine option. Click the Next button.5. On Step 2, type in the name of your virtual machine and select the Guest OS family and verions.a. For the Guest OS family, select Linux.b. For the Guest OS version, select Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Click the Next button.6. On Step 3, select a destination storage location for the virtual machine files. Click the Next button.7. On Step 4, configure the VM hardware with the appropriate specifications based on the Virtual MachineRequirements and Recommendations for VMware and your network. In this example, the follow spe-cifications are used:a. CPU: 4 (Note: Adjust the number of CPUs allocated for the virtual machine based on your minimumconfiguration or number of PDUs.)b. Memory: 8192 MB (Note: Adjust the amount of memory allocated for the virtual machine to at least theminimum required.)c. Hard disk: 200 GB (Note: 160 GB is the recommended minimum.)a. Expand the Hard Disk options by clicking the arrow to the left of the field.b. Under Disk Provisioning, select one of the following depending on your needs.i. Thin Provision to save storage space. For the thin disk, you provision as much datastorespace as the disk would require based on the value that you enter for the disk size.However, the thin disk starts small and at first, uses only as much datastore space as thedisk needs for its initial operations.ii. Thick Provisioned, Lazily Zeroed. Creates a virtual disk in a default thick format. Spacerequired for the virtual disk is allocated when the virtual disk is created. Data remainingon the physical device is not erased during creation, but is zeroed out on demand at alater time on first write from the virtual machine.iii. Thick Provisioned, Eager Zeroed. A type of thick virtual disk that supports clustering fea-tures such as Fault Tolerance. Space required for the virtual disk is allocated at creationtime. In contrast to the flat format, the data remaining on the physical device is zeroedout when the virtual disk is created. It might take much longer to create disks in thisformat than to create other types of disks.d. SCSI Controller: VMware Paravirtuale. Network Adapter: Select an available network adapter based on your own configuration and access.Ensure that the Connect checkbox next to this field is checked.f. CD/DVD Drive: Datastore ISO file (Note: Ensure that the Connect at power box next to this field ischecked.)g. CD/DVD Media: When you select Datastore ISO file in the previous field, you will be prompted toselect an ISO image for the CDROM. Click the Browse button to select the dcTrack file for theCDROM.Leave the other options at their default values.8. On Step 5, review your selections. Click Finish to create the virtual machine.9.

Master plan the cabinet layout in the entire data center. Utilizing 0RU Cabinets provides you with the totalnumber of cabinets that can fit in your data center based on a realistic layout that does not affect your report-ing of available Rack Units based on their Installed or Planned status. A Planned cabinet would representwould-be near term projects, versus a 0RU cabinet which would indicate where a cabinet could fit in a space,but there are no plans to add one there yet2. 0RU Cabinets can also be used for floor space reservations. Because 100% of the cabinets in the DataCenter could be placed and known to dcTrack, dcTrack would now be able to perform calculations and report-ing on those cabinets answering questions like “Do I have space for 5 new contiguous cabinets?\". BecausedcTrack’s new calculation does not count 0RU Cabinets against your license, they can be used freely in yourplanning process.3. 0RU cabinets are also useful for Storage rooms. The 0 RU cabinet serves as a representation of a palettewith the equipment stacked on top of it. Create as many 0RU cabinets within these Storage Rooms asneeded. Then assign the Items stored on each palette to a cabinet and select \"Above\" for the U Position.Examples of a Location with 4 or fewer Cabinets:1. IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame) or a Telecommunications Closet are typically found in large buildingswith multiple floors and are used to distribute structured cabling to a floor or a section of a floor such as anoffice. These rooms are typically small and contain a few cabinets, or open frame racks mostly full of patchpanels and a new network switch. As noted in the table above, cabinets in locations with four or fewer cab-inets use half a license. For example:a. A room with three cabinets uses 1.5 licensesb. A room with two cabinets uses one licensec. A room with five cabinets uses five licenses (Note: Rooms with more than four cabinets do not get thediscount)You will notice the effects of these changes when viewing licensing information in dcTrack Settings or the dcTrackLicenses Remaining widget, as each could now display a fractional value.Note: Use your dcTrack license in order to make a disaster recovery backup of your database, if needed."

The High Availability feature canhelp you minimize downtime due to outages, support redundancy as part of disaster recovery configurations,provide scalability, and eliminate single points of failure for large and geographically dispersed deployments.When a node is inactive (e.g. in the standby, isolated or incomplete state), users will not be able to log into the fulldcTrack application. Instead, they will be presented with the High Availability Standby Application (HASA) that canonly be used to review the cluster status and to restore an inactive node to service such that the full dcTrack applic-ation will be accessible. Only users with a local (non-LDAP/SAML) account that has System Administrator privilegescan log into this application.Note: A local (non-LDAP) System Administrator account is required to login to the system when it’s in the standbyor inactive states.The High Availability feature can be configured through the High Availability settings page in dcTrack in the Settingstab > Appliance Settings > High Availability.dcTrack supports a number of services that facilitate integration with Power IQ and third-party systems. As part ofthe High Availability feature, these services can be disabled or enabled (restored) as a group to avoid complicationsof having two active dcTrack systems due to either automatic or manual failover."

    "content": "A High Availability cluster consists of one primary node and one secondary node, each with a dcTrack system thathas been configured to support automatic or manual failover. When configured, data from the primary node will act-ively be replicated to the secondary node to provide a hot standby system in the event of an issue with the primarynode.When a node is inactive (e.g. in the standby, isolated or incomplete state), users will not be able to log into the fulldcTrack application. Instead, they will be presented with a High Availability Standby Application (HASA) than canonly be used to review the cluster status and to restore an inactive to service such that the full dcTrack applicationwill be accessible. Only users with a local (non-LDAP) account that has System Administrator privileges can log intothis application.The High Availability feature on dcTrack supports two types of failover:Pessimistic automatic failover: When automatic failover is enabled, if the primary dcTrack detects lost con-nectivity, it automatically will assume that the secondary dcTrack is active and will go offline. The primary willmaintain its data and can be re-enabled by users with the System Administrator role. When the secondarydcTrack detects lost connectivity, it will automatically assume that the primary dcTrack has failed and willbecome active.Manual failover. A user can manually initiate a failover from the primary dcTrack to force a failover to the sec-ondary dcTrack. They can either disable integration services or leave them active as part of this action. Notethat a manual failover can only be initialed when the cluster is operational.1. High Availability requires two dcTrack installations.2. Ensure that your environment meets the prerequisites. For more information, see High Availability Pre-requisites.3. When you initially set up a High Availability cluster, data on the designated secondary node is deleted andthe data from the designated primary is replicated to the secondary.4. When setting the Heartbeat Interval and Heartbeat retries values, be sure to take the following into account:You don’t want too low of a value that could cause nuisance failovers or for the cluster to transitionto a not operational state during restarts or short-term network issues.You don’t want to high of a value such that you lose operation of the system for too long of a periodof time in the event of an issue on the primary.Note that if the primary is down:For Auto Failover: The failover won’t occur until after the internal/retry periodexpires.For Manual Failover: You can’t make the secondary operational until the intervaland retry period elapses and the secondary declares lost connectivity and movesto the cluster to the Not Operational state.See Lost Connectivity (Heartbeat Intervals and Retries) for more information onthese values.5. Once a failover occurs, you will need to rebuild the cluster. You can rebuild it from either node but be sure tochoose the one that has the data you wish to preserve.6. It is recommended to configure an email notification in the event that a node declares lost connectivity. Formore information, see Lost Connectivity Email Notifications.7. When managing the nodes, you want to avoid a scenario where both nodes become active. Issues thatcould arise from this are:This could create integration issues between dcTrack and other systems. The High Availability fea-ture does provide a capability to disable the integration services on dcTrack.Users could make changes on the wrong system.8. Inactive nodes will not redirect to the active node. Consider using the appropriate networking equipment toensure that users are directed to the correct node.9. Ensure that you have at least one local (non-LDAP) user account with System Administrator privileges con-figured on the Primary node. A local System Administrator account is required to manage an inactivenode. User accounts on primary are replicated to the secondary and can be used when the secondary is instandby mode.10. Leverage dcTrack’s Remote Backup feature to ensure you have an extra recovery mechanism.11. Be sure to read the High Availability help section in its entirety."

It isimportant to complete these steps so all models and menu options are available to you during File Import.Ensure you do not miss a step by following the checklist provided in Checklist - Build Your First dcTrack DataCenters, and Add Your First Items, Connections and Users.dcTrack File Import is the recommended method to build one or more data centers since it eliminates many manualsteps. This includes automatically enabling Virtual Power Chains for each location individually, creating connectionswithin the cabinet such as from the server to the top of rack network, connections to a switch, connections frompower supply to rack PDU, the ability sync one or more Power IQs, and so more.It also helps organize your data since you can add all of your location, item and connection information to the FileImport. The template can be used as your Primary import file. You can then create individual files for import by sav-ing the Primary file under different names and including only the items for import.Note: You can still manually add data center locations, although it is not the recommended method. SeeUse FileImport to Add, Edit Delete and Move.Begin a File Import by clicking the Import button in the dcTrack main tool barAt a high-level, you will:1. Download the File Import template from the Import Page.2. Populate the template with your data. Save a primary file and create individual Import Templates by saving cop-ies.3. Individually import Locations, Cabinets, Rack PDUs, Devices, Data Connections and Power Connections.Note: dcTrack checks to ensure you do not exceed your cabinet licenses. Cabinets that exceed the license limit arenot imported and dcTrack informs you of this.4. Use File Import in the Web Client and follow the steps provided in the File Import dialog.5.

    "content": "You will need a UPS Bank for each power chain in your data center. Typically, data centers have 2 redundant powerchains. A UPS Bank is technically a Switchgear which in dcTrack is represented using the Class/Subclass AC Dis-tribution/Switch. Therefore, an AC Distribution/UPS Bank and AC Distribution/Switch electrically and functionally arethe same, but in dcTrack the UPS Bank is a special case of a switch since it is the switchgear that feeds from theUPS Units and distributes out to the Floor PDUs.1. In the Assets tab > Item List, click the Add an Item button. A new Item page will open in a new dcTrack tab.2. In the New Item page, select the UPS Bank’s make and model. You may use the Generic UPS Bank model.3. Assign a name to the UPS Bank.4. Select a location for the UPS Bank, if different from the one already selected in the Location dropdown.5. In the Configuration sub-tab enter the following information:a. Rating (A)b. Rating (Vac) - This should also match the Voltage of the UPS Units.c. Output WiringNote: The above 3 values are the specification of the Busbar that is inside the UPS Bank switchgear.d. Redundancy – this depends on the number of UPS Units that you will connected to the bank in Step 13below. You will want to update this value after connecting all the UPS units to this bank.e. Rating (kVA) and Rating (kW) are read-only. They are automatically calculated based on the numberof UPS Units that you will connect to the Bank in step 8 below and the Redundancy setting.6. Save the UPS Bank item.7. Repeat for any additional UPS Bank items.8. In the Switch Devices sub-tab of the UPS Bank, click the Create Switch Devices button and choose LoadDevice. You will repeat this step for as many UPS Units and Floor PDUs there are connecting from and to thisUPS Bank. A load device is the large breakers that are installed in the UPS Bank.a. Select the Make and Model for the Load Device.b. Give the Load Device a name. This name must be unique within the UPS Bank item only.c. Give the Load Device an optional number for easier reference within this UPS Bank.d. The Connector Type is inherited from the Model of the Load Device. If this remains blank, it is becausethe Load Device Model does not have the Connector Type set. You may want to create multiple LoadDevice models for each Connector Type you want to use. Each Connector Type displays it own sym-bol in the Single Line Diagram.e. Rating (Vac) is read-only and is inherited from the UPS Bank itself, which was selected in the Con-figuration sub-tab.f. Phase is read-only and is inherited from the UPS Bank itself. (It will show Three Phase Delta if theBank’s Output Wiring is 3-Wire + Ground, or Three Phase Wye if the Bank’s Output Wiring is 4-Wire +Ground.g. Rating (A) must be equal to or less than the Rating (A) of the UPS Bank.h. Derate 80%. Uncheck this box if the Load Device breaker is 100% rated.i. The remaining fields are optional.j. When the Rating (A) was filled in, you will notice a form appears to the right. This specifies how thisLoad Device connects internally within the UPS Bank switchgear.1. For a Load Device that feeds from the UPS Units select the following:1. Line Side:a. Connects to: Extb. Fed From: Select the UPS Unit’s Output.2. Load Side:a. Connects to: Bus A.2. For a Load Device that feeds to the Floor PDUs, select the following:1. Line Side:a. Connects to: Bus A2. Load Side:1. Connects to: Ext.Note: Bus B and Bus C are optional and would only be used when the Switchgear has more then one bus. Whenmultiple buses exist, a Load Device would connect them together. These 3 bus notations should not be confusedwith the 3 poles of a Three Phase circuit.k. Click Createl. Create all other Load Devices and select the appropriate selections at step j based on what this loaddevice will connect to.m. Save the UPS Bank Item.n. At this point, you should have a UPS Bank connected to the UPS Unit(s). If you go back to the UPS item(s) (Refresh it, if it was already open)and in the Configuration sub-tab, the UPS Output section should display the Bank name that this UPS Unitis part of and the total capacity of theUPS Bank. If this total is higher than expected, you may need to adjust the Bank’s Redundancy field.1. In the Assets tab > Item List, click the Add an Item button. A new Item page will open in a new dcTrack tab.2. In the New Item page, select the floor PDU’s make and model.3. Assign a name to the floor PDU.4. Select a location for the floor PDU, if different from the one already selected in the Location dropdown.5. In the Configuration sub-tab enter the following information:a. Rating (kVA)b. Rating (A) – Should be a number that is close to the result of this formula: Rating (kVA) * 1000 / (Rating(Vac) * SQRT(3) * NEC Derating), where the Rating (Vac) is the voltage of the item feeding the FloorPDU and the NEC Derating is 80% for Data Centers in the United States.c. Class/Subclass: Select UPS Bank optiond. Fed From: Select the UPS Bank Load Device feeding this Floor PDU.If you do not have a UPS Bank created, you can also select VPC UPS Bank from the drop-down. ACVPC must be enabled for the location in order to view VPC UPS banks in the drop-down. See Enableor Disable VPC for a Location.e. The Rating (Vac) and Input Wiring will be automatically filled in based on the Fed From selection.f. Save the Floor PDU item.g. Repeat these steps for each additional Floor PDU.h. In the Power Panels sub-tab of each Floor PDU, create one or more power panels that are eitherinternal to the Floor PDU (Local), remotely placed panels or RPPs (Remote), or busway systems feed-ing from the Floor PDU (Busway). Click Create a panel and fill in all the required fields to create eachpanel accordingly to the panel specifications. Note that the panel name needs to be unique only withinthe Floor PDU.i. Click Create buttonj. Repeat for each additional panel for this Floor PDU.k.

Click again to restore the color list to its original state10. To set Custom colors, click the edit icon in the Color Code List11. This will open a dialog box with the Color menu open and the selected field pre-populated. The selected fieldcan be changed to set color values for a different field.12. Initally all color assignments will be set to \"auto\" and the Custom Color column will be empty13. To set a custom color to a field value, select it from the custom color drop down. This will display the color inthe custom color field and change the assignment from \"auto\" to \"custom\". If a custom color has not beenassigned to a value it will appear in the list with the notation \"(Not used)\" next to the color. You can only applya color to one value. If you attempt to assign the same color to a second value, the color will be removed fromthe first value and the Color Assignment Default for that value will be set back to \"auto\".14. Clicking \"Clear All\" will remove all custom assignments and mark the color as \"Not used\".15. To revert a custom color assignment, change its assignment from \"custom\" to \"auto\". This will revert the colorback to the default color assigned by dcTrack. The custom color will remain selected in the Custom Color fieldand will still appear in the color drop down list as if it was assigned. Reserving the color in this way allows youto quickly flip back and forth between custom and default colors without having to reassign from the list. Sinceit will still appear in the list without the \"Not Used\" notation, users will know not to use this color for a differentassignment.16. Click the Save button to apply all assignments17. Click the \"Auto Assign Colors as Custom\" button to freeze color assignments. This will revert all colors to thedcTrack default colors, but will mark the color as \"custom\". This prevents inserting a new value from changingall of the colors after the new field. For example.a. Value AAA is assigned the color Redb. Value CCC is assigned the color Bluec. Value DDD is assigned the color Greend. Inserting a value of BBB will not affect the color assignments of CCC or DDD.18.

CAB3 -> 48Go to the Floor Map and you can see the cabinets in 3D as screen shot below.System Administrators and Global Gatekeepers can choose to highlight Items on Floor Maps by assigning colorsbased on Standard or Custom Field Values. For example, users can highlight and quickly see all of the Items for asingle Project or multiple Projects.Prior to dcTrack version 9.0.0 colors were assigned automatically and could not be changed. dcTrack version 9.0.0introduced the ability to customize colors allowing users to select which colors are assigned to each value.Color Coding is available in both 2D and 3D Modes.Note: dcTrack will assign up to 20 unique colors to the Floor Map. For this reason selections are limited to 20 Items.Steps to Color Code a Floor Map:1. Navigate to the Visualization > Floor Maps2. Select the Location whose Floor Map you want to see3. Click the Color button on the Visualization Tool Bar4. A sub Tool Bar is displayed with a drop down list for selecting the Field you want to filter onNote: Available fields include most Standard and Custom fields with the exception of Text and Text areafields and fields that are unique for each Item (i.e. Item Name).5. Once the Field is selected the second drop down list is populated with all of the values applicable to that field.6. The list will have all values selected, however you can deselect values to suit your needs7. The left Side panel will display the Color Code List with an Item list below. The Item list includes all items thathave a value set for the selected field. The floor map will also display with the colors applied.8. Initially dcTrack custom colors are applied9. The list as well as the floor map can be filtered by clicking the colors in the color box.a. Click once to filter out the selected color. The color inside the clicked circle will be cleared while allother circles remain solid. The Items associated with the selected color will be removed from the ItemList and the floor map. You may click as many colors as you like to remove those colors as well.b. Double click to filter out all colors except the selected color. The color inside the clicked circle willremain solid while the circle for all other colors will be cleared. The Item list and the floor map will filterout all Items for every color except the selected color. You may click as many other colors as you liketo add them back in.c. Click again to restore the color list to its original state10. To set Custom colors, click the edit icon in the Color Code List11. This will open a dialog box with the Color menu open and the selected field pre-populated. The selected fieldcan be changed to set color values for a different field.12. Initally all color assignments will be set to \"auto\" and the Custom Color column will be empty13. To set a custom color to a field value, select it from the custom color drop down. This will display the color inthe custom color field and change the assignment from \"auto\" to \"custom\". If a custom color has not beenassigned to a value it will appear in the list with the notation \"(Not used)\" next to the color. You can only applya color to one value. If you attempt to assign the same color to a second value, the color will be removed fromthe first value and the Color Assignment Default for that value will be set back to \"auto\".14. Clicking \"Clear All\" will remove all custom assignments and mark the color as \"Not used\".15. To revert a custom color assignment, change its assignment from \"custom\" to \"auto\". This will revert the colorback to the default color assigned by dcTrack. The custom color will remain selected in the Custom Color fieldand will still appear in the color drop down list as if it was assigned. Reserving the color in this way allows youto quickly flip back and forth between custom and default colors without having to reassign from the list. Sinceit will still appear in the list without the \"Not Used\" notation, users will know not to use this color for a differentassignment.16. Click the Save button to apply all assignments17. Click the \"Auto Assign Colors as Custom\" button to freeze color assignments. This will revert all colors to thedcTrack default colors, but will mark the color as \"custom\". This prevents inserting a new value from changingall of the colors after the new field. For example.a. Value AAA is assigned the color Redb. Value CCC is assigned the color Bluec. Value DDD is assigned the color Greend. Inserting a value of BBB will not affect the color assignments of CCC or DDD.18. Custom colors are applied to the floor map drawing objects that have custom colors set, while the otherobjects are set using dcTrack's default colors. The Item List Panel is also displayed using the same colorscheme as the floor map.Click the icon on the color tool bar to clear the filter and return the Floor Map to its original state.You can also assign Colors by clicking the Config icon on the Floor Map tool bar and clicking on the \"Color\" tab onthe left side menu."

Rather than having to create a new cabinet and add devices to iteach time you add a new cabinet, you just clone an existing cabinet, then edit the clone's information as needed tomake it unique.Update each clone's information so it is unique, such as updating the item names, by manually editing the inform-ation or using making bulk updates. Bulk updates are made by first exporting the clone's information to a .CSV file,updating the information in the .CSV, and then reimporting the file using dcTrack's File Import.Clone a single item, or multiple items at once. Depending on the item being cloned, you can elect to clone an item'sdata ports, power ports, sensor ports and custom field data. You can also elect to maintain parent-child relationshipsbetween items, such as the parent-child relation of chassis-blades.When cloning cabinets, you can elect to clone just the cabinet, or cabinet and all the cabinet's items. When youclone the entire cabinet and its items:All items within the cabinet are clonedAll zero U items on the cabinet, such as zero U rack PDUs attached to the front/back/left/rear of the cabinet, areclonedAll device items above and below the cabinet, such as a busway outlets, are cloned. Free-standing items, suchas floor PDUs, are not cloned; they must be cloned individually as single items or multiple itemsThe parent-child relationships between the cabinet (parent) and the items in the cabinet (children) is maintainedwhen a cabinet is cloned. For example, each child item in the cabinet remains in the same U position within thecabinet, the rail orientation of the child item remains the same and so on.The parent-child relationships between the children of the child items are maintained. For example, the rela-tionship between blades that are the children of a chassis within a cloned cabinet are maintained.The following are examples of parent-child relationships maintained during the cloning process where they alreadyexist for items and cabinets:Parent cabinet > Child devices in cabinet > Children of child devices within the cabinetParent chassis > Child bladeParent network stack > Child network itemsParent floor PDU > Child panel"

Additionally they can define list content for standard user-configurable lists and List type custom fields inthe Web Client.Role-based access control is also available for Custom Fields. System Administrators and Gatekeepers with theManage Lists role can create, edit, delete, and manage permissions for Custom Fields.Standard Fields are available by default in dcTrack, while Custom Fields can be added by authorized users.The elements contained in Standard and Custom List type Fields are used to populate drop-downs and menus indcTrack. For example, the Function drop down on Item Detail page is populated using the Item Function Pick List.Custom Fields assigned to Items, Item Models, Projects, Tickets and Locations can be viewed in up to 99 CustomField sub-tabs that can be customized by authorized users. Item Custom Fields can be placed in multiple panels oneach sub-tab in configurations that make the most sense for an organization's users.Custom Fields assigned to either Data or Power Circuits can be viewed on the Circuit Detail page for any Data orPower Circuit.Custom Fields assigned to Parts can be viewed on Part Instance and Part Model Custom Field sub tabs.Custom Fields assigned to Projects can be viewed on Project Custom Field sub tabs.Custom Fields assigned to Tickets can be viewed on Ticket Custom Field sub tabs.Custom Fields assigned to Locations can be viewed on the Location Custom Field sub tabsStandard Fields include default attributes that can be configured as needed so they fulfill your specific requirements.For example, you can add new customers to the Customers Standard Field list contents. Standard Fields are usedacross the dcTrack application.Custom Fields can be used to capture information specific to your data center needs that are not included in dcTrackby default. Item Custom fields appear in the Custom Fields sub-tab on the Item Details page while Circuit CustomFields can be viewed on the Circuit Detail page for any Data or Power Circuit, accessible by clicking the CircuitDetail icon on either the Circuit List or Circuit Trace tool bars.For details on available Standard Fields and how they can be used, see Standard Field Descriptions. For detailson Custom Fields, see Custom Field Attributes, Custom Field Types and Field Management Tabs.Custom Fields can be applied to one or multiple classes including Data and Power Circuits. For example, you cancreate a Custom Field called Installation Date, and then specify if you want to apply that field to one, multiple, or allclasses. You can also specify data types for your Custom Fields for better data integrity and quality control.Note: Upon upgrade to dcTrack 6.3 from a pre-6.0 release, the existing custom fields will be displayed in two panelsin a single Custom Fields sub-tab. Upon upgrade to dcTrack 6.3 from Release 6.0 or later, Custom Fields will dis-play as in the post- 6.0 release.Note: Customize Standard and Custom Fields before you create your first data center locations and add items andconnections for the first time. Add attributes to fields so they are available when you perform an import. This isimportant because dcTrack does not add items to fields during the import. Trying to import information that is not ona field causes errors during the import, and you must manually fix them before that data is added.Standard and Custom Fields can be managed under the Settings tab > Field Management.

    "content": "MTP/MPO fiber patch panel-to-patch panel connections are the same as any other connection between two items.However, MTP/MPO fiber patch panel-to-network/device item connections using an LC-harness are more complex.The connection is complex due to the one-to-many relationship between the multiple LC connectors that plug intothe network/device item ports.dcTrack 9.2.0 introduces a new property Channels which applies to Connector, Model port and Item port. Channelsare used to track the number of circuits that can run through the port (i.e. communication paths). A port with multiplechannels can accept multiple connections. For example: 6 (1-channel) ports with LC connectors can all connect to asingle Port with MPO connector having 6 channels. This allows 6 circuits to be created that are all using the sameMPO port.Prerequisites for building MPO Circuits.1. In the Connector's library, create MPO connector and enter a value for the Channels. For example an MPO-12 should have 6 channels, MPO-24 should have 12 channels. If you already have MPO connectors in theConnector's library, update the Channels value.2. Define the connector compatibility for MPO connectors so that circuit can be built between the ports havingmpo or non-mpo connectors.3. Create MPO ports on your items. If you do not have items created in dcTrack , follow the steps here Add andEdit Items to create items. For best practices, it is recommended to create MPO ports directly on the model.This ensures that any items created from the model will automatically inherit the ports.4. Next, create structured cabling. See here Create Structured Cabling with MPO Data Panels if you have MPOData Panels, otherwise see here Create Structured Cabling to create structured cabling. You can skip thisstep if structured cabling is already created or you do not manage structured cabling."

    "content": "MPO circuits can be built in dcTrack in the same way as other data circuits. However, since MPO ports support mul-tiple connections, each port must have multiple channels.Consider the use case below where a server port that is an LC 1-Channel is connected to the Data Panel that hasMPO 6-Channel Connectors and which is further connected to MPO 6-channel Switch ports.The cord used on the left side is typically referred to as \"Octopus\", \"Breakout\" or \"Harness\". 5 more circuits can becreated from 1-Channel ports in Node 1 and the rest of the circuits comes up as previously built circuits.Steps to build circuits this circuit in dcTrack:1. In Connectivity, add a circuit and select the item and the port for the first node.2. For the second node, select the data panel which has the MPO port. The far end right panel is shown as thethird node.3. For the fourth node, select the network item that has MPO port.4. Save the Circuit.When the circuit is saved it will have two records in the Circuit List, one full circuit and one shared right partial circuit.In this case the two data panels and network switch form a shared right partial circuit. The shared right partial circuitcannot be disconnected when used in a full circuit.Since the MPO port on the data panel can still accept five more connections, it will appear in the list of availableports when building a circuit. This port will no longer appear in the list when all its channels are connected.You can also build all 6 circuits for this use case in the same tab by selecting 6 servers ports together from itemdetails page, when the first node is the same item for all the 6 circuits and then selecting the MPO data panel portand for the fourth node, selecting the network MPO port.When these circuits are saved, the circuit list will have 7 records where 6 circuits are full circuits and 1 circuit is theshared right partial circuit.Circuit trace will also show the Leg value when two ports on either side of the cord have different number of chan-nels. In this use case the first node of the circuit is 1 channel port which connects to 6-channel MPO port, hence the6 circuits have a Leg value from 1 to 6. Leg value here indicates which leg of the Octopus or Breakout cable the Cordis using.The Cord Information dialog also includes a Leg field to indicate which leg the cord is using. This field appears onlywhen the two ports on either side of the cord have a different number of channels. This field is a drop-down and theoptions includes the leg numbers available for connection.For example, when a single-channel server port is connected to a 6-channel MPO port, the drop-down menu willoffer options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with 1 selected by default. After the circuit is saved, the available options will be 2, 3,4, 5, and 6, indicating that Leg 1 of the cable is in use. This field is editable, so you can change the leg value to otheroptions available in the drop-down.A new column Breakout Leg is added to the Circuit List which display the Leg value for each circuit. This column willbe blank when all the ports used in the circuit have same number of channels.View each circuit node info by clicking the hamburger icon on each node. This opens a menu with the followingoptions.1. Item Details – Click here to go to the Item Details page of the selected node.2. Port Inspector – Click here to open the Port Inspector for the item of the selected node.3. Show in Floor Map- Click here to see where the item is in your data center. You will be redirected to the Visu-alization tab showing the floor map of your data center.4. View Partial circuit – You will get this option only if this circuit was built using a partial circuit. This option willdisplay the Partial circuit in the current tab.You can also view cord information for Patch Cords and Structured Cabling between two nodes.To view cord information, click on the patch cord or structured cabling between two nodes. This opens a dia-log window with the associated cord information.If you have opened the circuit in edit mode, you can also edit the Patch Cord Information. Saving the circuitalso saves the cord details.You can only edit cord information for patch cords, for structured cabling the Cord Information dialog is readonly.If your circuit is built using a partial circuit, the cord information for the partial circuit will not editable whenopened from the full circuit. You can edit the cord information in the partial circuit which will update the cordinformation for the full circuit."

The dcTrack Universal Connector and the ServiceNow Connector provide the ability to createAssets on the CMDB system which can be inserted automatically on dcTrack, additionally, the ServiceNow Con-nector provides the ability to create assets on dcTrack that are automatically inserted on ServiceNow. Both Con-nectors support bi-directional updates.dcTrack version 7.2.0 and beyond support integrating a single ServiceNow Instance to multiple dcTracks. This isfacilitated through the new certified Sunbird DCIM Connector application available through the ServiceNow Applic-ation store (see Configuring the Sunbird Connector in ServiceNow). Once the new Connector application isinstalled, users will be allowed to create any number of dcTrack configurations, each pointing to a different dcTrack7.2.0 or later instance. If you chose to continue to support a one-to-one relationship between dcTrack and Ser-viceNow, no additional changes are required to your current configuration, however if you would like to integrate withmultiple dcTracks you need only create additional configurations for each instance supplying the same few para-meters to identify each dcTrack instance. When integrated with multiple dcTrack instances, the DCIM Connectorapplication automatically associates the individual field mappings, Locations and filters specific to each dcTrackinstance to the correct dcTrack.System Administrators can configure the CMDB Connector under the Settings > dcTrack Settings > Integrations >Asset & CMDB.Note: You must perform the following steps in each dcTrack instance you wish to integrate.To configure the CMDB Connector:1.

Yellow highlighted fields should bereviewed to ensure dcTrack's suggested value is acceptable.Since the dcTrack Class field is optional and does not have to be mapped in the cmdb config. When pushing data todcTrack, the following rules are applied:1. Any Time the mapped Model exists on dcTrack, the Class will be derived from the Model2. If the Model does not exist but the mapped Class is a valid dcTrack Class, an Incomplete record will be cre-ated using the mapped Class..3. If the Model does not exist and the Class is either invalid or not mapped at all, an incomplete record will be cre-ated and its Class will default to \"Device\". When the record is corrected its Class will be updated to the Classof the specified Model.Note: There will be some cases where the Model used to correct the record is of a Class that can not be changedfrom \"Device\".

Navigate to Settings > VMWare Inventory Sync2. Select the VM Manager from the VM Manager drop down list in the top right corner of the page. Since theobjects in VMWare do not yet exist in dcTrack, their status will appear as In VMWare Only.3. Select the dcTrack host from the left panel and the VMWare host from the right panel that you wish to Mapand click the Map button on the tool bar.4. Repeat step 3 for each VM host you wish to integrate.If the hosts are associated with a Cluster in VMWare and the cluster does not exist in dcTrack, the status of themapped hosts will appear as Incorrect Parent. The status of these hosts will be changed to Integrated when yousync the VMWare cluster, which will automatically add the cluster to dcTrack.5. If the mapped hosts in VMWare are associated with a cluster, select the cluster and do a sync.Once the sync operation is complete, the cluster is added and all the virtual machines that are associated with thathost are pushed to dcTrack.If the mapped hosts in VMware are not associated with a cluster you can either sync each host one at a time orschedule an auto sync for that VM manager. Scheduling auto sync will integrate the hosts that are mapped andchange the status to integrated.Note: If a host is not associated with a vm manager dcTrack allows users to manually maintain the list of related vir-tual machines/clusters. Once integrated with a vm manager, it can only be done via the integration and users will nolonger be allowed to make those changes manually."

One end of the tag is adhered to an item and the otheris plugged in to the asset sensor.A Asset sensorB Asset tag(s) for the IT device(s)C IT device item in a rackThe asset sensors are connected to a EMX or PX2 and configured in them.Note: This image depicts a connection to an EMX-888 for example purposes only.Once asset sensors are connected and configured, they transmit the asset tag ID and positioning information to theEMX or PX2.You can add each item an asset tag is attached to dcTrack, and add the EMX or PX2 to dcTrack. If you provideSNMP information for the EMX or PX2, event information can be transmitted to dcTrack. Specifically, Power IQdetects when an asset tag is connected or disconnected from an asset strip. Power IQ then generates an connect ordisconnect event.When dcTrack polls Power IQ, the connect/disconnect events are pulled into dcTrack.The events are displayed on the Events page in the dcTrack Web Client. For a list of the events that are monitored,see Asset Management Sensor Event Information.To poll and display asset management events in dcTrack -The EMX or PX2 that the asset sensor is connected to must exist in dcTrack.EMX devices are identified as probes in dcTrack; PX2 devices are identified as sensors.Each item connected to the asset strip via an asset tag must exist in dcTrack.You do not need to manually enter the asset tag IDs for items that already exist in dcTrack as long as the items are inan Installed status.Simply, plug the item's asset tag in to an asset management strip that is connected to an EMX or PX2 that exists indcTrack. dcTrack automatically assigns the asset tag ID to the existing item.Note: If needed, the asset tag number can be overwritten.For more details on dcTrack as well as how asset sensors work with dcTrack, contact Sunbird Professional Servicesand Support from the http://support.sunbirddcim.com."

Navigate to Settings > Models library2. Click the Policies button on the Model’s list tool bar3. From the Manage Power Budget Policies screen, click the Create button and supply the following informationin the Policy Details panel:a. Policy Name: Name of the Policy (Required)b. Period: Range for which to collect readings from Power IQ. Readings collected from the Items duringthis period will be used for calculating the Auto Power Budget value. (Required)Valid Options:Past DayPast WeekPast MonthPast 60 DaysPast 90 DaysPast Yearc. Granularity: Frequency with which readings will be polled and stored for future calculations. Optionsfor Granularity depend on the selected option for Period. (Required)Daily Period > HourlyWeekly Period > Hourly, DailyMonthly Period > Hourly, Daily60 day, 90 day and Yearly Periods > Hourly, Daily, Monthlyd. Statistic: Setting which determines how the readings gathered within the Granularity time frame shouldbe aggregated to derive a single value. For example, an Average statistic for a Daily Granularity set-ting results in the Average of each days readings (Required)AverageMaximumMinimume. Summary for Items: This determines the aggregation method applied to all the readings in a givenPeriod, Granularity and Statistic to derive a single value for each Item. For example, a Past WeekPeriod with Daily Granularity and Maximum Statistic results in 7 Daily Maximums. Then if the Sum-mary is set to Average, the 7 Daily Maximum readings will be Averaged to yield a single value for anItem. This value becomes the Auto Power Budget for the Item after applying the \"Ignore Top and Bot-tom (%) and \"Additional Safety Margin (%) settings. (Required)a. Averageb. Maximumc. Minimumf. Aggregation for Models: This determines the aggregation method applied when calculating the AutoPower Budget value for the Model. The values that result from the \"Summary for Items\" setting foreach Item are calculated base on this setting to yield a single value for the Model's Auto PowerBudget. (Required)a. Averageb. Maximumc. Minimumg. Only Installed Items Qualify: If checked, only Items that have been in the Installed status for a periodgreater than or equal to the selected Period of the Policy will be included in the Auto Power Budget cal-culations. Items that have been installed for a shorter period will remain excluded until enough timepasses and they qualify for a subsequent run for the Policy. If unchecked, Items in the Planned,Planned for Decomm, or Installed statuses will be included in the calculationh. Ignore Top and Bottom(%): This setting is used to exclude extreme high and low readings before apply-ing the \"Summary for Items\" and the \"Aggregation for Models\". For example, if this setting is 1, thenthe Top 1% and the Bottom 1% of Items will be excluded before aggregating the Items to calculate theModel's Auto Power Budget. (Required)Range can be from 0 to 50%i. Additional Safety Margin (%): Percentage value that will be added to the summarized value of eachitem. The result will be the Auto Power Budget for that item. For example, an Item's Summarized valueis 105 Watts and the Additional Safety Margin (%) is set to 20%, the Auto Power Budget for the Itemwill be 105 x (1 + 0.2) = 126 Watts.4. Click the Save Button to save the settings.Complete Example:a. Policy Name = Defaultb. Period = Past Yearc. Granularity = Dailyd. Statistic = Maximume. Summary for Items = Averagef. Aggregation for Models = Maximumg. Only Installed Items Qualify = Checkedh. Ignore Top and Bottom(%) = 5i. Additional Safety Margin (%) = 15Policy Default is assigned to Model A. Model A has 120 Items, but only 100 Items have been in the installedstatus for 12 months or more.Readings for the 100 items are collected. Each Item will have 365 daily maximums. The 18 highest and low-est readings are discarded (365 X 0.05 = 18.25). 329 readings per Item remain. They are averaged per Itemand multiplied by 1 plus the Additional Safety Margin (%). The result for each Item is used to set the AutoPower Budget. Then the Auto Power Budget of the 100 Items are used to calculate the Model's Auto PowerBudget by first discarding the highest and lowest 5 items, leaving only 90 Item's Auto Power Budget values.The maximum of the 90 Item's Auto Power Budget is used as the Auto Power Budget for Model A."

To create Rack Transfer SwitchPower Ports via file import follow steps below.1. Download the Import Template from Export -> Download Import Template or from Help -> ImportTemplate.2. In the Import Template go to the tab Data, Power & Sensor Ports and follow the instructions.dcTrack allows you to track the Active and Preferred status for Rack Transfer Switch (RTS) Inlets. Forintegrated RTS, the status is retrieved from Power IQ . For non integrated RTS, the Active status canbe set manually.While in Edit mode, you can switch the load for both integrated and non-integrated RTS, however ifintegrated with Power IQ, the next refresh from Power IQ will reset the Active status to once againmatch the status from Power IQ.The Preferred and Active state will appear beside each port name for integrated RTS.For non integrated RTS only the Active status is displayed and will also appear beside the port name.A single integrated RTS inlet can also be both Preferred and Active.The load can only be modeled on connected Inlets. If the load is manually switched to a disconnectedinlet it will automatically revert back to the connected Inlet. To modify the Active inlet, select the Inletfrom the \"Model Load on Inlet\" drop down. Note, only connected Inlets are enabled in the drop down.When switching from one connected Inlet to another, upon saving you will receive a message indic-ating \"\"This will change the inlet feeding all the rack pdu outlets wired to the transfer switch andall circuits connected through these outlets will be updated to the selected inlet.\""

For example, you may decommission a server to storage but bring it back at a later date fora new purpose.Decommissioning an item to storage is also an alternative to deleting an item that is no longer in a Planned status, oran item you do not want to purge from the application.To decommission more than one item at the same time, use Ctrl + Click or Ctrl + Shift commands to select items onthe Items List.To decommission an item t o storage:1.

From the Actions menu, select Decommission Item to Storage Request to submit the Decommission Item toStorage Request.5. Select Yes when prompted to confirm.6. If the selected item is a cabinet, the following apply:7. All items in the cabinet are decommissioned.8. All Data Panels are removed from the Cabinet and set to a Planned Status: When the cabinet has DataPanels, the Cabinet and U position for the data panels are cleared and the status is set to Planned.9. All Power Outlets assigned to the Cabinet are unassigned and left in place: When the Cabinet has Power Out-lets, the Cabinet and U Pos are cleared, but the Row and Position In Row remain. The statuses of the PowerOutlet do not change after the cabinet is decommissioned.10. The following check-box options are available if the item to be decommissioned is a cabinets:a. Keep items mounted in the Cabinet: When checked and the decommissioned item is a cabinet, theCabinet and U Position of each Item in the Cabinet are retained (not cleared). When un-checked andthe decommissioned item is a cabinet, the U Position of each item in the cabinet is cleared. For itemsintegrated with Power IQ, the cabinet field of items that are decommissioned is retained, so that the his-torical readings of those items remain with the cabinet.b. Keep Rack PDUs mounted in the cabinet: When checked, the cabinet and U Position fields of anyrack PDUs are retained (not cleared). When unchecked, the cabinet field remains unchanged, but theU position is cleared.c. Keep Data Connections that are within the Cabinet: When checked, all (both Planned and Installed)data connections that do not extend outside of the cabinet are retained. Planned data connections thatextend outside of the cabinet are deleted. Installed data connections that extend outside of the Cabinethave Disconnect Requests issued.d. Keep Power Connections that are within the Cabinet: When checked, all (both Planned andInstalled) power connections that do not extend outside of the cabinet are retained. Planned powerconnections that extend outside of the cabinet are deleted. Installed power connections that extendoutside of the cabinet have Disconnect Requests issued. When un-checked, all planned power con-nections (both within and outside the cabinet) are deleted.a. i. A connection between an item's power supply and a Rack PDU outlet where both theitem and Rack PDU are in the decommissioned cabinet is considered a connectionswithin the cabinet.ii. A connection between an item's power supply and a power outlet is considered outsidethe cabinet.iii.

Other-wise, it will behave as if the Keep Power Connection option is not checked.

You can then purge the items from dcTrack if needed.Once an item is in an Installed state, it cannot be delete from the item's page or in the Item List page in the Web Cli-ent.

For example, whenan item is added it is in a Planned status. After an Install Item Request is submitted for the item and the request isprocessed and approved, the item moves into an Installed status.The same applies to circuits but different statuses are applied to them. Circuits are in a Planned status when theyare created.
